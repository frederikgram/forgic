# Forgic

## About

Forgic is a relatively naive compiler, which has to purpose to compile .mcg (my custom grammar) files into x86 ASM .s files.
these .mcg files represent source-code which, defined by this compiler, is a purely sequential language for simple mathematical operations.

This project is made for the purpose of improving my systems-programming abilities and as a bonus, test my command-line argument parsing library "corree".
